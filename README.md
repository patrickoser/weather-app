Cards:
  - I could dynamjically render each card depending upon what data i pull in instead of hard coding each but for now I am hard coding each individual card since I know I just using a three day forecast.

Context:
  - Context is not entirely necessary but I want to use it for practice/refresher, same goes for some light prop drilling. Could just grab location/searchData in App and prop drill the values to Form/Cards. Use the COntext file for all useEffects and other state that needs to be used in either component.
